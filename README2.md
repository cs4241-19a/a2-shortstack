## Technical Achievements
- **Limited input type and submission**:  The code specifies the type of each input so that user cannot enter anything other than number in to the scoring field. Users are also not allowed to submit any uncompleted match result.
- **Auto Sorting**: Used a very little amount of code in 'server.improved.js' to achieve the effect of auto sorting.
- **Correct Number Comparing**: Even that both of the variables are numbers, direct comparing will lead to a wrong result. The code will only compare the first digit of each number. Thus, phareInt is added to the front of the variables to ensure the correct comparison.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Simple to understand**: Since this is a robotics competition assistant, the interface is designed to be very simple. Shown in 'style.css', the code makes everything properly stand around middle. The text is large and background color of teams is specified so that users can easily under stand the concept.
- **Hover Reaction**: The proper hover reaction can tell user which button/tag is available. Whenever users hover over a input/button/tag, if the element is available, there will be reaction. If the button is not available(like submit button won't be available until every field is filled), uesr can easily tell because of the style and lack of reaction.
