## Robotics Competition Assistant
The goal of this webpage is to provide a match result recorder as well as a ranking system to a robotics competition or any other similar competitions.

The user need to give the system a match number, teams in that match and their score. The system will record the match and determine the winner automatically. Then, the system will update the rank by the number of matches each team won. User can view the both Match History and Rank by click on the tags. They can also edit or delete matches in Match History.

The main challenge for this system is that it is hard to rank the teams since the dynamic features(user can add/edit/delele matches at any time). To solve this problem, I decided to use two lists which one is used for match recording and one is for rank recording. Each time the Match History renewed, both lists will be refreshed and re-iterated in order to get the lasted ranking. 

It turns out the ranking system works fine with this idea and I also added the code to sort the list so that rank from high to low. There are several things can be down to make this web page more useful. First, most of  
Here is a sample formula for summarizing your activities, talk about:
- the domain area the project pertains to
- the main challenges or problems the application addresses
- the key innovations that make it possible to address the problem
- the main results of the implementation, does it really address the problem?
- any additional implications of the resulting application, or possibly areas for future work that have been discovered as part of the design and implementation activities

(Note that when I use the above formula, I aim to have only one sentence per thought in order to remain concise.)
