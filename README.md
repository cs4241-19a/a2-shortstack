Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  

## Football Stats Tracker
- This project pertains to football statistics processing.
- The application addresses the problem of storing all of the information throughout the course of a football game by splitting up each play.
- The use of html forms allows the user to easily input data.
- The current application is a very basic implementation that does not fully solve the problem.
- For future work, a database would be helpful to store data persistently to ensure it is not lost when a session is ended. Also, further analysis using the provided data would be useful.

## Technical Achievements
- **Use of TextArea**: As part of the form I looked into the use of addtionally html elements such as text area and input lists.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Provided Alt For IMG**: Provided an alternate image tag to ensure text-only viewers can still find the application usable.
