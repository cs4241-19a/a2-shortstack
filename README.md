## Homework todo list

This project is a to do list app for homework assignments. It allows for adding, removing, and checking off items.

Note: The server and project are working perfectly for me on multiple local machines. However, on Glitch, adding any assignment throws my error that it already exists. I can't figure out why this is. If the grader would be so kind as to consider running the project locally to see it working I would be very grateful. I have also included a video file of the app working as intended on my machine in this repo.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievements**: My main tech achievements were involved with the responsivness of the page. Using javascript, I figured out a way to add and delete items in the todo list, as well as change the colors of elements. I also was able to delete data from a server when an item was 'deleted' by the user. Another tech achievement was on the server. I wrote a functoin to search through the appdata array and find the index of an object, or return a value if the object did not exist. I was able to use this to validate input to make sure a user couldn't put in an assignment with the same data twice. I could also see if an assignment was marked as done or not, so pressing the check button a second time not only marked the HTML element as not done, but changed the data in the server as well. Although it overlaps with design achievements, I was happy with the CSS work I did and how it was able to enhance the feel of the page by using transitions, colors, mouse-over changes, etc. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievements**: My design achievements were small but many, and helped the page come together. Although I had help from an example linked in scripts.js, I ended up changing or completely rewriting most of the CSS. Some examples of these design achievemnts include - determining how the size prop of text inputs affected style, and how to remedy to get them looking as intended and working better with the date inputs; redesigning the color scheme; adding spacing and working with flex rules to align everything properly, and more.
