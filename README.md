## Book Tracker

I love to read but I often find myself forgetting the book suggestions that people tell me, or vice versa not being able to provide suggestions on the spot.
This project is an organizational tool to keep track of all the books you have read and you want to read, showing not only the name of the books and authors
but also a comments section and ratings which furthermore sort the books into sections based on if you did or didn't like them. The easy to view website While this is a personal organizational
tool at the time, in the future I could envision it as a forum for book lovers to share their best/worst book picks.


Here is a sample formula for summarizing your activities, talk about:
- the domain area the project pertains to
- the main challenges or problems the application addresses
- the key innovations that make it possible to address the problem
- the main results of the implementation, does it really address the problem?
- any additional implications of the resulting application, or possibly areas for future work that have been discovered as part of the design and implementation activities

(Note that when I use the above formula, I aim to have only one sentence per thought in order to remain concise.)
