This is a submission by Michael Bosik for assignment 2 in Webware.
For this assignment, I created a javascript game that requires the player
to match up cells of equal values to merge into one cell. The score increases
the more cells are merged.

Here is a sample formula for summarizing your activities, talk about:
- this project is a 2-stack web application that involves a front end javascript game and web page and a back end javascript server
- the main challenges creating this project were figuring out how to interact with my server in terms of payload...I didn't realize there was a body-parser :(
- something I had wanted to accomplish was graph keypress data that each player had made. If you look in game.js, the keystrokes are in fact recorded, I just did not have the time to look into data visualization
