## Assignment 2 - Short Stack: World of Warcraft Classic Create a Character

In the honor of the launch of Classic World of Warcraft, I decided to make a character creation page at the only time I'm off the game. This page has the key innovation of assigning the faction (Alliance or Horde) to the appropriate race/class combo that's being passed from the server side. Then, the blank level 1 character is created. 

This project aims to help the WoW addicts who might get the urge to play while stuck at work/school. By creating a level 1 character with any combination over and over again to reduce the craving, these people can finally get their minds off WoW and focus on work.
