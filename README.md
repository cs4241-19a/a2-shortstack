## Update 1:50 PM 9/9
The professor asked me to add a message to the top of my README, as I had difficulties with this assignment.

I attempted to go deeper than I should have with this project, and it caused me to waste far too much time writing things that didn't work just to delete them. Currently, the project lacks functionality for displaying the submitted forms in the table. Unfortunately, I was unable to find what was going wrong (as were others who I asked) and threw in the towel at about 5 am due to people breaking things in my house and myself having to be the person to fix them on multiple days this weekend. Hopefully, I was just missing something small as opposed to being completely off the mark. Any feedback after grading would be appreciated. 

## House Job Tracker
This project is designed to assist in tracking house jobs for the house that I live in.
The user is able to add, edit or clear house jobs for both days of the week on which they are done.
The app seeks to keep house job assignmetn organized to reduce the possibility of people forgetting or not being able to find out they're own house job
Further development is needed for the app to be useful for more than a personal record of house jobs, as it does not have persistent storage.
