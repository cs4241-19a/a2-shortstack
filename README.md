## Generic Leaderboard
https://csmbrad-a2-shortstack.glitch.me/

This project is a simple time-based leaderboard. Grids are used to position the elements, and a Table is used to create ther results.
I could not get the results to show up in the table, trying to request them at the start makes the site hang and I can't figure out why.
The server does support adding, removing, and editing entries.

I believe my sortdata function on the server side is borked. That and my table display doesn't work. I would appreciate feedback on these issues, as I can't figure it out.
