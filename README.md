## Pizza Ordering Website

My website allows you to order pizza from Classic Pizza, allowing up to two toppings per pizza. 
You can order a new pizza, see the orders currently being worked on, edit them, and delete them.
Click on the "View Current Orders" link to see the table of current orders, and click on the "Order now!"
link to bring back up the form to order a new pizza.

## Technical Achievements
- **Instantiated an HTML table in Javscript**: Learned how to fill in the rows, columns and values of an HTML
                                               table from within Javascript code, using information stored on the server.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Accessibility**: I included aria-labels for my page links in my navPane and put the main functionality of my page
                     into the main tag of the html rather than using another div tag.
