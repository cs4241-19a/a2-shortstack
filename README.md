Based on my experience with creating math problems and designs for mathspring.org, an intelligent tutoring system, 
I decided to create a login page and roster for a set of teachers. While there are many ways to elaborate on my 
original plan, I did not have enough time to explore all of my options for this page. I would have liked to have built 
a page where several users could log-in and look at their roster, as well as the grades that accompany each student. 
The teacher would be able to remove students from their class and add new students. When the 'information' button 
is clicked, the teacher can add grades and assignments to the student chosen. Preferably, there would have been
a navigation bar at the top of the page to switch between assignments and account information for the target student.

Because the database, password serveice, and server required a lot of time to get started, I found myself with less time 
than intended to piece together my design. With the remaining time I was able to build a login page, as well 
as the beginnings of a student roster and list of assignments. Students can be added and removed from the list, 
and the more information button brings the user to the list of assignments. The teacher can add assignments as well 
as remove them. Though, I was unable to complete more of my original ideas beyond these features, the web app still 
provides a few options for the user and does so in a responsive and clear manner.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I completed the technical aspect of the assignment 
by creating a lowdb database that stores various information and provides it to the web page when necessary.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Prior to the creation of the web application, I put great thought into my ideas and design. 
I found the CSS Template to be greatly limiting, however I was still able to create a clean user interface appropriate 
for its purpose. I prepared my web application with some simple drawings to sketch out my ideas on paper. With a 
prototype in hand, I moved onto building the web app itself.

- **Design Achievement 2**:
