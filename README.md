## Your Web Application Title

This project allows you to rate your stress on a scale of 1-10 and specify how much time you have free. This produces what level your stress is, an activitiy to relieve that stress and how long that activity will take. You must select a stress level when submitting, or else the application will not work properly. I used flexbox to center the table in the div, and margin: auto to center the div on the page. I also used background-image to display an image as the background and used various different colors and fonts throughout the page.

## Technical Achievements

1. Henriques
2. She wishes there was a way to submit the form using enter. Also mentioned that the table should scroll when the list gets too big rather than the whole page. She also liked my color scheme and tohught thefonts worked well together.
3. I hadnt thought about the idea of clicking enter to sumbit.
4. I would add functioality to submit the form using the enter button, and add a scroll to the tabel once it reaches a certain amount of items
