## PC Performance Tracker
My website is a performance tracker for PCs. It allows you to enter statistical
information and calculates performance based off those inputs.

My goal was to give myself an easier way to track PC health over time.

The "All Performances" table shows all the data stored on the server side.

The "Best Performing Games" table calculates averages off of the server data

THe "Computer Health" section shows your PC's health based on a simple algorithm

My website implements my initial goals well. In the future I want to calculate computer health based on
a better algorithm. I also would like to improve the computer health section style to make it more pleasing. 
I could also add more statistics. Lastly, I want to add a button that can populate the fields automatically 
(by getting the current fps, cpu temp, and gpu temp).
