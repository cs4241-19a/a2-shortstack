## Programming Languages

This site is intended to simply show the interactions between the
the server during transactions. The server stores the input information
for a short time in memory. The idea is to store it persisently for the next
upcoming project which will be a continuation of this.

The project is about programming.
It is intended to be a quick resource for quick information.
The main challenges were getting the functioning of the webstack working together as one.

Future TODO:
-Get more data for diffrent languages
-Work more on the server code as networking is an interest of mine.
-Implement a database with working data retrieval and addition using sql of some sort.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using a combination of serverside scripting and front end js was to
solidify a better understanding and basis for javascript. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Learning about the different methods allowed from the htttp objects 
and used them to my advantage .

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Actually wrote out my css code, as I know there are various ways to 
have it done for yout but I figured doing it out is better at this time.
- **Design Achievement 2**: UX: Tested the code with my brother, and tweaked it based on the 
results
