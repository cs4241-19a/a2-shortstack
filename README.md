## Robotics Competition Assistant
The goal of this webpage is to provide a match result recorder as well as a ranking system to a robotics competition or any other similar competitions.

The user need to give the system a match number, teams in that match and their score. The system will record the match and determine the winner automatically. Then the system will update the rank by the number of matches each team won.

Here is a sample formula for summarizing your activities, talk about:
- the domain area the project pertains to
- the main challenges or problems the application addresses
- the key innovations that make it possible to address the problem
- the main results of the implementation, does it really address the problem?
- any additional implications of the resulting application, or possibly areas for future work that have been discovered as part of the design and implementation activities

(Note that when I use the above formula, I aim to have only one sentence per thought in order to remain concise.)
