Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js

## Soccer Stats Stars
This website is designed for people who are building a fantasy soccer team,
 or who just want to have a place to analyze their favorite player's statistics.
This website enables a user to compile his or her own list of her favorite players, and can even input themselves.
On other websites for soccer statistics, it is much harder to compare players from different leagues and levels.
This could be further implemented to rank players for fantasy teams with the addition of statistics and an ordering of the data.

I will be commenting the link to my glitch site. Please note: I ran into problems in my forked repo adding in a results page. I had to start over in a different directory, I am linking this zip file here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LjmDA6BStvc8APoQJjLTtTks7vMuMQW9 . You must use download this folder, navigate into it and run server.improved to run the website properly and be able to access my results functionality. Sorry for the difficulty, I didn't know how else to still make a pull request but include this new project since I couldn't get it to work.

### Technical Achievements
- **Technical Achievement 1**: I added an alert message to let the user know data was added to the table.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Shown in `style.css`, I styled both html pages without using a template sheet but instead by researching individual aspects of the design (like the table design and the button design).
