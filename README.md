## Pico Fermi Bagel : A Guessing Game

To make a guess simply select your mode, type in your guess (4 digit 0-9), and submit, the server will handle the rest. A game will begin as the previous one ends.

For the CSS grid or flexbox requirement, I used a grid to align my fields in a tile layout.

This project is a number guessing game that gives you multiple options to accurately find a number on the server. The gimmick is that you can pick what hint you'll receive for each guess. Hot or Cold mode will give you a higher or lower answer, which, when combined with Pico Fermi bagel, incentivizes a more unique way to approach the puzzle. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The user immediately receives a response back that gets put into the Past guesses section. The past guesses section includes all fields that will be stored in the server and contains two derived fields which say the score associated with the guess, based on how close you'd get if you tried to guess the number via bisecting the range over and over. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
