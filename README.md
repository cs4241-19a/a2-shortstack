Include a very brief summary of your project here.
Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text.

Here is a sample formula for summarizing your activities, talk about:
- the domain area the project pertains to
- the main challenges or problems the application addresses
- the key innovations that make it possible to address the problem
- the main results of the implementation, does it really address the problem?
- any additional implications of the resulting application, or possibly areas for future work that have been discovered as part of the design and implementation activities

(Note that when I use the above formula, I aim to have only one sentence per thought in order to remain concise.)
