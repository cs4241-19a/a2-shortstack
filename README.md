## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: created a login system that does not allow duplicate users (users with the same username)
- **Tech Achievement 2**: created a function to show the password to the user 
- **Tech Achievement 3**: created a basic encryption function to prevent the admin from reading the passwords (i couldn't get a toggle working to flip from encrypted to unencrypted, but you can just change the encrypt flag in "loggedin_admin.html" to "false" in order to ensure it is working properly)
