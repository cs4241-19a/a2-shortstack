Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===
## Work-Play Balance

The website intends to help user find a balance between work and leisure tasks in their day. It helps to combat a 
person's unhealthy tendency to either work, or stay unproductive for a long period of time. The website has a table 
showing their list of tasks and a single bar visualization to show the work-play ratio on that day. These address 
the problem as intended as they help keep track of the user's tasks. Possible future plans for this include displaying 
more interactive visualizations related to the results.
