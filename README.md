## User Management
Made a small way to keep track of users and their data, along with admin privledges and remembering users
By using localstorage I can keep track of users throughout user sessions
While this tries to solve the problem of keeping track of users, it is very bare bones in terms of features, and because of the lack of any server, if the server goes down for any reason all user data is lost.
I hope that in the future I can add a sql server to this in order to keep track of users better, as well as a better way to keep track of users, as currently a user could modify their localstorage in order to pretend to be someone else.

## Technical Achievements
Using localstorage, I am able to keep track of user nicknames through different browser sessions, and keep individual sessions independant.
