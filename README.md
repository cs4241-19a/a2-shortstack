## Rowing Split Calculator
The application creates a way to store basic rowing data and adds a calculated split for 500 meters which is standard in the rowing community. This will help boats be able to see their race times in one place and compare the boats.
The calculation of the split and a site that where it is all in one place, as rowing results are scattered online. The result of this with the firebase allows all the information to be stored on one site instead of being scattered across the internet.
There are two modes to the site, one where you can submit a row, and results where you can view the entire database.
