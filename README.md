## Lost Words

Lost words is a web app that allows users to make a account and store writing entries. The app
will give user feedback, such as word frequency, synonyms and rhyming words, as well as tools for
searching for definitions. A writer's toolkit in attempt to never be lost for words!

TODO: ADD IMAGES

Here is a sample formula for summarizing your activities, talk about:
- the domain area the project pertains to
- the main challenges or problems the application addresses
- the key innovations that make it possible to address the problem
- the main results of the implementation, does it really address the problem?
- any additional implications of the resulting application, or possibly areas for future work that have been discovered as part of the design and implementation activities

(Note that when I use the above formula, I aim to have only one sentence per thought in order to remain concise.)
