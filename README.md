- the key innovations that make it possible to address the problem
- All you have to do is enter data about your vehicle and you can compare the best vehicle to either take from your own car collection or rent to be more fuel efficient and for those on a budget.
- Future work: Ask for starting point and destinations to calculate the number of miles of the trip.

- a `Server Logic` which, upon receiving new or modified "incoming" data, includes and uses a function that adds at least one additional derived field to this incoming data before integrating it with the existing dataset ✓

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a function to verify that the user does not add the same exact data for a car to the data table. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Implemented two server logic calculations, one for calculating the total gallons and the other for total cost using the user input and the already existing columns of data. 
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Data is persistant. When you go back on your browser, refresh, or even close your browser, the data that you previously inputted on the site will still be there. 
- **Tech Achievement 4**: Set up a connection and learned how to use the Firebase Database. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I tested my website with 4 users and found that they really liked the use of colors. I used a color palatte and theme to find the best suitable colors which are pink, green, blue, and gold. 
- **Design Achievement 2**: Shown in `style.css`, I created the stylesheet myself from scratch. I implemented the containers based on the user input from above for more information and better usability.
- **Design Achievement 3**: For adding data to the data table, I created my own table and added some CSS to make it look more presentable and user friendly.
