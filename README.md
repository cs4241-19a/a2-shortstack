##Title: Log your next adventure

This is an app where users can log their travels. Users input their name, place they started from and place they went to, and the app will give them the distance traveled?

- This project aims to help people keep track of their miles traveled for personal records
- This app aims to give users more insight on the extent of their travels and help them remember where they have been to in more concise way
- This app wants to solve the problem that users can have remembering where they have been after traveling for a long time or frequently
- Future steps for the application would be:
    - Adding the same functionality for flights,
    - Adding dates for more record-keeping, 
    - Adding an option of inputting money spent,
    - Adding the carbon footprint left on each trip
    - Showing trips on Google Maps as pins 
    - Adding button to calculate total miles traveled

**Note:** The video will take a while to load in the background the first time the server starts

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Used bootstrap to lay out the form in a visually pleasing way
- **Design Achievement 2**: Added floating letters for the title text
- **Design Achievement 3**: Used a video for the background to inspire users
- **Design Achievement 4**: Parallax-style layout where the background stays the same while the content changes 
- **Design Achievement 5**: Jumping arrow to go to area where data is shown in a table

- **Design Achievement 7**: Used Fontawesome icons for edit and delete functionality
- **Design Achievement 8**: User doesn't need to focus on inputting the places in a well-formatted way to get correct distances. Only exception to this I know of is that when you simply put in Worcester, it automatically thinks you mean Worcester, UK
- **Design Achievement 9**: User can click view places in new page button to go to a new page and only get the place table without other distractions. This can be used for accessibility or simply for cleaner printing of data
