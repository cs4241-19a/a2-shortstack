## Fake Sushi Restaurant Order-app

This webapp was inspired by the restaurant that I have been working at for 3 years. 
No other type of database would I be more familiar with than a food system. One of the harder challenges
was getting everything to just *work*. learning how to do the post and gets correctly was the biggest challenge
and looking online helped me a lot to implement them, along with a lot of debugging. 

The way the app works is that you type in your information and choose what fish you'd like, how you'd like to have it,
and of course how much you'd like. After hitting submit, you'll be given an Order ID which you can use to search your order,
and have the option to modify it.



(Note that when I use the above formula, I aim to have only one sentence per thought in order to remain concise.)

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Keeping multiple views in check without the need for reloading the site constantly or the use of iFrames.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Being able to throw around the object in order to be able to retain ticket info and pre-fill boxes when modifying an order


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Aligning some of the CSS around to make it look more like a legitimate website. 
- **Design Achievement 2**: Using alerts to confirm the actions of users, making sure the "Order ID" box is unmodifiable so users can't cheat the system. On that same accord, users MUST put in numerical values in phone number and the quantity.
