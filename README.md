## Zodiac Calculator / Horoscope Database
The purpose of this comedy.
The application calcualtes zodiac signs based on a given birthdate, and gives users the opportunity to revieve a random horoscope for a person entered into the database.
(All horoscopes were generated using https://www.wordblanks.com/mad-libs/misc/story_137920/played/4032093/?new=1)
An area for future expanision would be the addition of a persistant database and the addition of an internal horoscope madlibs generator.

## Technical Achievements
- **Dynamic Dropdowns**: When adding or modifying information in the database, the dropdown for the day of the month dynamically changes based on the month selected. 
- **Dynamic Displays**: The buttons on the navigation bar at the top of the page dynamically hide/show the relevant functionalities of the buttons
- **Completed Server Logic**: The user can add, modify, and delete, multiple pieces of infomation per visit. Additionally The user is not allowed to add duplicate information (Exact same first name, last name, month, and day)


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Bootstrap Carousel**: Implemented a bootstrap carousel displaying zodiac images. Adapted from https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp
- **Flexbox Top Menu**: The buttons ate the top of the page dynamically relocate because they are in a flexbox.
- **CSS Requirements**: Implemented the use of id, class, and tag selectors in an external stylesheet. Used CSS to horizontally center the data table.
