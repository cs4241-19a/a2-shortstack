## People Information Safe

This website is a place where you can store information about a person to a database. Just enter a person's name, birthday, and favorite food, and it will add it to the database as well as figure out the person's age.

This website is useful if you need to keep a long list of people you know and want to remember what food they all like.

Granted that is more of a made up problum but I still think it is useful.

I really feel like I went all out on this website. The only area I could think of improving in the future is color choices and stuff.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I am unsure if this was a requirement or not, but incase it wasn't I will list it here. I store all of the information in a json file, so all of the information can be saved forever.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I made it so you can not submit something without having everything filled out. This way you don't accedently send incomplete data.
- **Design Achievement 2**: I was unsure if this was a requirement or not, but incase it was not I will list it here. I added delete and edit buttons to all of the entries so you can manage all of your entries and make sure there is not any errors or outdated information. There is also a delete all button if you just want to restart.
