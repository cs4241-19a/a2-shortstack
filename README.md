## Create Your Own Library
This project allows users to create their own library. Users can input the name of the book, the author, 
a brief description and the publication year (range set from 1300-2100). It organizes the 'library' with 
all the info on a table, displayed on the library page. This program also adds a column of which century
the book was published based on the inputed year.

Here is a sample formula for summarizing your activities, talk about:
This program helps organize a user's books in a readable format.
For me, I've had to move a lot between school, internships, and home. Reading is very important to me and when 
I move I like to keep most of my books with me (which is a lot). However, because of all the moving, I've definitely
have forgotten to bring certain ones. This helps users to centralize their books and remember which ones they have. 

While this doesn't let users have the entire content of each of the books, it helps users keep track of which books
they do own. 

Areas I want to include in the future is to not allow users to enter blank textbox information. (Require that they have
to enter in something for each field). Also I might want to implement different libraries (based on genre or year). I also want to 
change the format from a table to possibly something akin to a bookcase.
