My website allows you to order pizza from Classic Pizza, allowing up to two toppings per pizza. 
You can order a new pizza, see the orders currently being worked on, edit them, and delete them.

## Technical Achievements
- **Instantiated an HTML table in Javscript**: Learned how to fill in the rows, columns and values of an HTML
                                               table from within Javascript code, using information stored on the server.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Accessibility**: I included aria-labels for my page links in my navPane and put the main functionality of my page
                     into the main tag of the html rather than using another div tag.
