## Best Movies in the WORLD
This website presents the best movies (according to my opinion, but also allows the user to add movies to the page).There were a lot of challenges getting the server to work with the page. Also to geth the users input to add to the table of movies. I looked up ways to connect the server and try and project the user input onto the page. The page could use a lot more styling and maybe more information on the movies.
