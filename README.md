## Start Your Fitness Journey 
My project calculates a user's Body Mass Index(BMI) after getting the user's name, height, and weight as input.
The project takes the users height and weight and outputs their BMI. 
Unfortunately, I had difficulty producing a list of the all of the results that displayed on the page.
While working to get a list populated on the page, the functionality of printing the BMI was lost. 
I am aware that this project is not complete with all requirements, but after running into issues this is my submission.






## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using a combination of javascript and html as seen in scripts.js
- **Tech Achievement 2**: In index.html, I used select options for the units entered by the user. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Shown in `style.css`, the code includes a background image, background color, a second image, and padding to move the text to the 
right side of the page.

I referred to the w3schools website for a lot of pointers on my css file, js files, and my html file.
