## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I completed the technical aspect of the assignment 
by creating an array of objects to alter during the use of the webpage.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Shown in `style.css`, there are many style aspects creating a 
type of 'dark mode' of a Daily Scheduler. In `style.css` there is formatting  necessary to make 
the page readable and aesthetically pleasing. Addiotionally there are key frames that allow
the last day of the week to slide in rather than the entire line jerking to the left. 
The user can add an event with the Add to Schedule button as well as change the day with the
next day button. This next day button allows the user to line up the day of the week with a white 
border to better exemplify the current day. Tasks are deleted as the day resets to the end of the week.

- **Design Achievement 2**: In my experience, calendars often fail to highlight the priority of 
works due to their static format. By creating a sliding calendar, the user can see the current day,
update tasks, and have a better sense of urgency as tasks literally draw closer. As of right now there
is no way to delete tasks individually, but if I had had extra time I would have devoted it to creating that feature.
