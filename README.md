Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

Due: September 9th, by 11:59 AM.

This assignment aims to introduce you to the concepts and practice involved in creating a prototype (i.e. not deployment ready) two-tiered web application. 

The baseline aims of this assignment involve creating an application that demonstrates the use of several specific pieces of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js functionality.
Another aim of this assignment is to establish creative boundaries in which you and your partner can explore designing, implementing, and evaluating usable, useful, novel, and technically efficient web applications.


## Foodify (Recipe lookup tool)
  Web scraper that gets meal recipes from allrecipes.com, displays a recipe and shows past searches from other users

- I used web scraping for this project (library called cheerio), the library was awful but I managed to make it work, I used descriptive tags (nav, article and such), and styled my css properly
- I had already done a web scraper for this website for a discord bot in C#, so thats where I got the idea
- I think it came out pretty well, even though it took a little to get use to the tools I was using
- I would love to add a little bit more to the scraper, to display an image of the recipe and show the calories
