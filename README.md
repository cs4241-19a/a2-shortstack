Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

## To-Do List
This application is a basic online to-do list where users can add tasks with given due dates and time estimations and see how long they have until the due date.

- The project aims to be a to-do list.
- The main challenge the application addresses is forgetting what you have to do for a class or other task.
- The key innovation that make it possible to address the problem is the ability to see how long until the day the assignment is due.
- The application really does address the problem.
- Areas of future work could include sorting the list based on due date, or color coding items that have certain esitmations of time.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: The application provides a form for users to submit data and responds to the user submitting data by returning and displaying the server data alongwith the derived attribute.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Implemented a time remaining derived attribute that has the server calculate the time until the given due date and sends it back to the client.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Shown in `style.css`, the webpage contains gradient color backgrounds, and "mouse over" UI changes.
- **Design Achievement 2**: We tested the application with n=1 users (Last name: Moran), finding that they had no problems with the design. They tried inputting dates in the past and negative estimated time so that would be something to prevent the user from entering in the future.
- **Design Achievement 2**: The application will not let the user submit an empty task and will display a message and provides visual feedback to invalid data.
