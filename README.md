Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  

## https://a2-rorysully-rory-sullivan.glitch.me/
My application is a website for Mrs. Puffs boating school. The front page allows you to choose professor
or student. If you choose professor, you will go to a new webpage with a table of all your students in your
class along with information about them. If you go back and choose student, the new page allows you to enroll
in a class by typing your name. This will display temporarily in the table. However, if you then go back to the
professor page, the professors table has been updated to show a new list of all students in the class, including
whoever had just enrolled. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Create a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and 
always shows the current state of the server-side data. To put it another way, when the user submits data, 
the server should respond sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) 
and the client should then update its data display.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Test your user interface with other students in the class. Define a specific task 
for them to complete (enroll a student in a class, ensure success from professors end), and then use the 
think-aloud protocol to obtain feedback on your design (talk-aloud is also find). 
Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
* Reardon
* Parker
* Morrissey
What problems did the user have with your design?
Originally, the number of car accidents was a decimal number, which is impossible. This has been fixed. The user
found it easy to navigate the site, however suggested a back button instead of using the browsers back button. This
is something that I would implement if given more time. 
What comments did they make that surprised you?
They really liked the fact that I had a title page. This is something that I thought many people would have, however
neither Reardon or Morrissey did, so this was a unique feature to them. They also enjoyed that if the user doesnt put
in, for example their last name, the application will catch this and fill the table in with "No Last Name Given".
What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
If given more time, I would add a back button to my interface to make navigation between pages easier, as mentioned
 previously.
- **Design Achievement 2**: I used a color pallete found online in my website. It can be found in the files.
